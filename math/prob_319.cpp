//man I am forgetting my own methods now. But there was one plus point in this one. Opened the discussion tab(which I had never opened prior) and I saw 
//saw someone comment that whenever you see such questions, wherein you got no fucking clue, just write down the cases all by hand and try to see a pattern
//So I wrote them down and kinda could see something. Whereas the yesterday's me would have straight up went to the solution. So yeah, I think I have 
//hopefully moved in the direction of regaining my skill atleast. (Still can't deny the fact that I am still piss low on confidence and hence why 
//I am not attempting any contests rn, cuz even if I knew a solution, the mental barrier right now is huge)
